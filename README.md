## Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Within my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I've used specific features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
- Training regimen results with epochs = 100 produced a loss of 55% and accuracy of 73%
